# Under-sampling-and-Over-sampling

A classification data set with skewed class proportions is called imbalanced dataset.
To solve this, we use re-sampling methods.

1.Random over-sampling -- Duplicating minority class examples
                          Decision regions smaller and specifc
                          Problem of Over-fitting
2.Random under-sampling --reduce majority class examples
                          reduce useful information
